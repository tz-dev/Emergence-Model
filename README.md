# Emergence Model for a Developmental AI Child

## Overview

This repository hosts the conceptual framework for **Emergenzmodell v1.6**, a minimalist, threshold-based model for simulating an embodied AI child. The goal is to enable emergent behaviors—such as self-efficacy, volition, planning, and protolinguistic grammar—using simple components like thresholds, noise, a Success Log, and an imagination space. Inspired by developmental psychology, the model emphasizes endogenous motivation and conflict-driven maturation without relying on extrinsic rewards.

Currently, the repository contains the initial documentation, including an overview and a detailed concept paper. Implementation and further development are planned.

## Repository Structure

- **notes/**  
  - `Emergence Model.md`: Brief summary of the model's core ideas and components.  
  - `An Emergence Model for a Developmental AI Child.md`: Concept paper detailing the architecture, mechanisms, evaluation KPIs, and expected emergences.  
- **README.md**: This file, providing project context and status.

## Current Status

The project is in the **conceptual phase**. The uploaded documents outline the theoretical foundation and roadmap for implementation. Key features include:

- **Minimalist Design**: Uses simple components (FSM, grids, thresholds) for easy implementation.  
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Self-efficacy, will, and language arise from non-linear interactions.  
- **Phased Roadmap**: Development from sensory mapping (P0) to social dynamics (P5).  
- **Evaluation KPIs**: Metrics like map stability, volition ratio, and external-to-internal drive ratio for tracking progress.

## Next Steps

- Implement a minimal viable product (MVP) for Phase 0 (P0) focusing on sensory mapping and basic logging.  
- Develop a Python-based agent and Godot-based environment as described in the pre-paper.  
- Define and test initial KPIs for validation.

Emergence Model for a Developmental AI Child (v1.6)
1. Core Assumption
Objective: Simulate an artificial agent ("child") whose abilities, motivations, cognition, and language are not fully pre-scripted but emerge through thresholds, training, interaction, conflicts, and contextualization.Principle: Minimal base parameters + threshold conditions + noise ‚Üí dynamics ‚Üí autonomous developmental steps.Parallel to Book 2: Blockades (conflicts, disturbances, noise) are essential for maturation, as they force the child to develop new solutions. Self-efficacy ("I act ‚Üí the world changes") arises via a Success Log.üëâ Trivial in its components, complex in its emergent dynamics.

2. Architecture Overview

3. Genetic System
3.1 Definition

Initial values + threshold conditions + noise (Œµ ~ N(0, 0.05)).  
Determines unlocks (movement, interaction, language, planning).  
Dynamic shifts: Thresholds and parameters shift via noise, daily moods, Success Log.  
Hysteresis: Gates checked only on smoothed metrics (EWMA) + dwell_time ‚â• œÑ + refractory time œÑ_ref.  
Development emerges through conflicts, randomness, and feedback.  
Early Phase Imprinting:Parameters from P0‚ÄìP1 (e.g., noise Œµ, w_proximity) act as long-term "bias" in later phases.‚Üí Enables simulation of developmental asymmetries and neurotic patterns(e.g., high Œµ ‚Üí unstable word-image coupling, excessive anxiety ‚Üí exploration inhibition).

3.2 Mechanisms

Initial Phase (Baby): Only head movement ‚Üí perception.  
Unlock Movement: After mapping ‚â• 90% ¬± Œµ + stability.  
Unlock Interaction: After exploration ‚Üí objects appear.  
Unlock Social Dynamics: Upon abstraction of "caregiver" category.  
Unlock Language: After X=5 word repetitions.  
Unlock Thought Channel: After Y=10 word-image couplings.  
Unlock Planning: After Z=20 Success Log entries ‚Üí imagination space active.  
Coherence Errors: Anxiety ‚Üë + learning bonus ‚Üë.  
Caregiver Proximity as Dominant Success Factor (Early Phases):Proximity & interaction with caregiver count as primary success sources in P0‚ÄìP1 (e.g., "being carried" ‚Üí mapping).As development progresses, base weight (w_proximity ‚Üì) decreases, while exploration need increases, forming new objects/rooms categories independent of the caregiver.‚Üí Prevents permanent dependency, ensures gradual autonomization.  
Risk-Weighted Bonus: bonus = PE¬∑(1‚àírisk); persistent high PE ‚Üí penalty.


3.3 Genetic Parameters

Head Movement: Range (¬±60¬∞, trainable to ¬±120¬∞), speed (0.4 rad/s).  
Movement: Speed (0.3 m/s), range (unlockable).  
Vision: Number of rays (24‚Äì36), range (expandable).  
Motivation: Exploration, proximity, fatigue, coherence.

Daily Moods: Influence weightings & exploration.  
Volition: Proportion of planned vs. reactive actions.  
Risk-Score per Action: Distance to wall/unknown.  
Satisfaction Level / Cooldown:motivation(obj) = base¬∑novelty¬∑(1 ‚àí satiation[obj]); satiation decays at night (dream) or over time.Hard-Guard: Max. n_consecutive interactions per object_id, then forced task rotation.

4.3 Learning & Memory

Core Memories: Caregiver, ball, first word.  
Dream Phases: Replay scenes (70/30 old/new), prioritized replay by prediction-error.  
Consolidation: EWC-Light or L2-Anchoring.  
Categorization: Rooms, objects, caregiver.  
Forgetting & Reactivation:Non-core memories degrade without repetition,reactivated and strengthened by new contact (visual or linguistic).Dream phases stabilize via replay mix (70% old, 30% new).  
Developmental Asymmetries:Early disturbances or parameter drift (e.g., high noise, slow w_proximity decay)can lead to long-term learning shifts(e.g., delayed language, stable room mapping ‚Üí functional asymmetry).

4.4 Imagination Space

Definition: 2D buffer (32√ó32).  
Multi-Scale: Grid + topology graph.  
Developmental Stages: Still image, single-step probe, multi-step planning.  
Will: Actions from internal simulations.  
Task Prioritization: Active plan temporarily suppresses other needs.  
Plan Budget/Timeout + Interrupts (fatigue, danger, caregiver distance).  
Reality-Check: Planned scene requires external match.  
Pre-Check (Lightweight):Before execution, an alignment-score A ‚â• Œ∏_pre must hold (e.g., match of expected door-bearing / visual signature). Cheaply computed; prevents "blind" plans.  
Post-Check:After execution, update prediction-error & Success Log (success or learning bonus on failure).  
Plan Commitment:min_commit_steps per plan; termination only by safety-interrupts (danger, fatigue, caregiver distance, external events).

Early phase: Caregiver proximity = success.  
Diversity Bonus: For new goals, diminishing returns for repeated successes.  
Score Decay: Successes/failures decay exponentially.

6.2 Mechanics

Entries with time, goal, action, result, type, mood.  
Success: Motivation ‚Üë, thresholds ‚Üì.  
Failure: Anxiety ‚Üë, alternative paths.  
Neutral: Stabilization.  
Extrinsic‚ÜíIntrinsic:Caregiver praise initially generates success(type="social_praise"); its contribution to the success score decreases daily via Œ±_t (see 3.3).Effect: Volition increasingly relies on self_success (goal achieved/plan succeeded), not praise.  
Object Satiation (Obsession-Guard):Per object_id, satiation[obj]‚àà[0,1] increases with repetition; motivation boost ‚àù (1 ‚àí satiation[obj]).At satiation[obj] ‚â• s* ‚Üí cooldown & diminishing returns in Success Log for that object.

7.3 Caregiver

Names objects, responds to cries, confirms language.  
Roles:  
Phase 0: Naming.  
Phase 2: Interaction.  
Phase 3: Coherence enhancer.  
Phase 4: Grammar.


Aging: Less active, death.  
Gradual absence + replacement anchor (homebase).


Praise‚ÜíSelf-Signal:In P0‚ÄìP1, caregiver praise counts fully (Œ±_t‚âà1), from P2 daily reduction (Œ±_t‚Üì), from P3 only a weak modulator ‚Üí promotes self-efficacy without dependency.


8. Emergence Mechanisms

Thresholds: Progress ‚Üí abilities.  
Context: New objects/categories.  
Conflict: Colliding needs.

Language Metrics: Word learning rate (MIC/F1), proto-sentence frequency.  
Emotional Dynamics: Anxiety-/cry-rate, mood distribution.  
Ablation Tests: Mood off, dream off, gates off ‚Üí measure effects.  
[New] External‚ÜíInternal-Drive-Ratio:E2I = self_success_contrib / (self_success_contrib + praise_contrib) ‚Äî should increase over time.

1. Comparison to Existing Models

RL / World Models: Also build internal simulations, but rely on reward. ‚Üí In yours: Success Log = no extrinsic reward, but endogenous, multidimensional (proximity, exploration, language‚Ä¶). ‚Üí Different.  
Embodied AI / Cognitive Robotics: Have needs, but mostly hard-coded. ‚Üí In yours: Needs + thresholds + mood + noise = dynamic balance.  
Predictive Coding: Very close to your "coherence = error vs. expectation," but there abstract; in yours: concrete, trivially implementable (FSM + maps + logs).  
LLMs: Massive language capability, but without grounding. ‚Üí In yours: Grounding explicit via word-image coupling.

This means: You cover overlaps, but the specific combination is not established.

2. Core Idea

Trivial Components (FSM, grids, counters, thresholds, mood as ¬± value).  
Emergence through Interaction (not through massive training datasets).  
Meta-Layer Success Log = driver for self-efficacy ‚Üí rarely found in other approaches.  
Imagination Space as minimal "Imagery Buffer" ‚Üí planning + will emerge.

This yields an architecture not directly present in any classical model.

3. Theoretical Feasibility

Programmatic Implementability: Yes, trivial ‚Äì each part is a simple algorithm (grid, FSM, counter, JSON log).  
Emergence Potential: High ‚Äì because conflicts + noise + thresholds = nonlinear, thus open to surprises.  
Limit: Not guaranteed what consciousness emerges; but the framework enforcing "growth through conflicts" exists.
